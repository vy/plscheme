PL/scheme is a PostgreSQL procedural language handler for Scheme programming
language released under BSD license. PL/scheme uses Guile in the background as
its Scheme interpreter. With lots of builtin SRFIs, GOOPS framework and complete
R5RS compliancy of Guile, PL/scheme will power up PostgreSQL procedures in your
favorite programming language!

For more information you can visit project web site at
https://volkan.yazi.ci/plscheme/

_/_/_/_/_/ COMPILATION & INSTALLATION /_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/

You'll need Guile (version >= 1.8.0) to be able to compile and run PL/scheme.
But luckily, most of the Linux/BSD distributions provide Guile by default, or at
least there should be a binary package of it appropriate to your distribution.

The most easy (and suggested) way to compile compile and install PL/scheme is to
use install.sh script that comes with the package. (See `./install.sh --help'
for details.) It's also possible to follow below steps that goes into depths of
the compilation and installation process.

First of all, you'll need to compile plscheme.c file to have plscheme.so unless
you downloaded a binary version of PL/scheme.

#
# While compiling from sources, pay attention to Guile library directories and
# PostgreSQL directories exposed by pg_config. Also, you need to define
# MODULE_DIR to make PL/scheme locate place its Scheme files.
#
PG_INCLUDEDIR=`pg_config --includedir-server`
PG_PKGLIBDIR=`pg_config --pkglibdir`

cc -g -Wall -fpic -c \
  -DMODULE_DIR=\"$PG_PKGLIBDIR\" \
  -DMAX_CACHE_SIZE=64 \
  -I$PG_INCLUDEDIR \
  -o plschemeu.o plscheme.c
# You can also use a -DSAFE_R5RS flag to get a trusted PL.

cc -lguile -shared -o plschemeu.so plscheme.o

cp plschemeu.so $PG_PKGLIBDIR
cp init.scm $PG_PKGLIBDIR
cp dataconv.scm $PG_PKGLIBDIR

After you've got a .so file by manually compiled from source or downloading a
binary file, you can easily install PL/scheme into a specific database via below
SQL command:

CREATE FUNCTION plschemeu_call_handler()
  RETURNS language_handler
  AS '$libdir/plschemeu' LANGUAGE C;

CREATE LANGUAGE plschemeu
  HANDLER plschemeu_call_handler;

If everything went ok and you still get these kind of error message while trying
to load plschemeu.so:

FATAL:  could not load library "/../plschemeu.so": /.../libguile.so.17: undefined
symbol: pthread_create

Just use -lpthread flag while linking plschemeu.so. (Or prepend -lpthread into
your LDFLAGS environment varible just before calling ./install.sh script.)
